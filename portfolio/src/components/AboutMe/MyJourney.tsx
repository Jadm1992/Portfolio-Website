        My journey into tech started in 2019 when I began teaching myself web development. I enrolled in a software
        engineering bootcamp, where I gained a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks. Over
        time, I transitioned into IT support roles, where I discovered my passion for working directly with people,
        troubleshooting real-world problems, and delivering solutions that make technology more human.
