        I bring a rare combination of technical depth and user-first mindset. With hands-on experience across desktop
        support, mobile device management, network troubleshooting, and cloud tools like Azure and Microsoft 365, I'm
        equipped to keep systems running and people supported. I’m reliable, adaptable, and committed to clear
        communication — whether I’m solving issues or writing clean, reusable scripts to prevent them.
